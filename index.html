                        target="_blank">video game</a> developed by <a

                    published by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>. It was
                    released worldwide for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"
                        target="_blank">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"
                        target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One"
                        target="_blank">Xbox One</a> on December 1, 2015. It was also set to be released for <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X" target="_blank">Xbox Series X</a>. The game
                    puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player
                    assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage,
                    defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but
                    features a series of short, offline missions called, "situations" that can be played solo. These
                    missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for
                    future encounters with the "White Masks", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.

                        Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots</a>, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative.
                    However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided
                    to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core of the Rainbow Six franchise and believed that
                    letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game
                    most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual <a

                        target="_blank">counter-terrorism units</a> and looked at real-life examples of sieges such as
                    the Iranian Embassy siege. Powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnvilNext"
                        target="_blank">AnvilNext 2.0</a>, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to
                    create destructible environments.</p>

                        Expo 2014</a>, it received four nominations from <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Critics_Awards" target="_blank">Game Critics Awards</a>
                    including Best of Show. The game received an overall positive reception from critics, with praise
                    mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was
                    criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the
                    game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a "<a

                    best multiplayer games in the modern market due to the improvements brought by the post-launch
                    updates. The company partnered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESL_(company)"
                        target="_blank">ESL</a> to make Siege an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports"
                        target="_blank">esports</a> game. In February 2019, the game surpassed 45 million registered
                    players across all platforms.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                </p>
                <p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game, in which players utilize many
                    different operators from the Rainbow team. Different operators have different nationalities,
                    weapons, and gadgets. The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams are not always
                    balanced in their choices of abilities. The base Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play
                    are the American Hostage Rescue Team (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT), the British SAS, the
                    German GSG-9, the Russian Spetsnaz and the French GIGN, each of which has four operators per unit
                    split between attackers and defenders (other units were later added through downloadable content,
                    see below). Players also have access to a "Recruit" operator who can choose from a more flexible
                    assortment of equipment at the expense of having a unique gadget or the ability to customize their
                    weapon. Players can pick any operator from any unit that is defending or attacking before a round
                    starts, choosing spawn points as well as attachments on their guns but are not allowed to change
                    their choices once the round has started. An in-game shop allows players to purchase operators or
                    cosmetics using the in-game currency, "Renown", which is earned at the end of matches from actions
                    performed in-game. Different gameplay modes award renown at different rates, with ranked matches
                    offering the largest renown multiplier potential per match. Players can also complete in-game
                    "challenges" to get a small amount of renown. Renown gain rate can also be affected by the using
                    in-game "boosters" which gives the player a 100% increase in all renown earned for various duration,
                    starting with 24 hours. A premium currency known as "R6 credits" can also be purchased using
                    real-world currency to get operators quicker in-game, or other cosmetic.</p>
                <p>When the round begins in an online match, the attackers choose one of several spawn points from which
                    to launch their attack while defenders do the same from which to defend from. A one-minute
                    preparatory period will then commence wherein the attackers are then given control over
                    mecanum-wheeled drones to scout the map in search of enemy operators, traps and defensive set-ups in
                    addition to the target objective(s), while the opposition establishes their defences and tries to do
                    so without having the defensive and target objective(s) details being discovered, chiefly through
                    destroying the drones. Maps in the game are designed to encourage close quarters combat, and players
                    cannot respawn until the end of a round. Players who were killed by opponents can enter "Support
                    Mode", which allows them to gain access to drone's cameras and security cameras so that they can
                    continue to contribute to their team by informing them of opponent locations and activities. Matches
                    last only four minutes for a casual and three minutes for a ranked. Teamwork and cooperation are
                    encouraged in Siege, and players need to take advantage of their different abilities in order to
                    complete the objective and defeat the enemy team. Communication between players is also heavily
                    encouraged. The game also has a spectator mode, which allows players to observe a match from
                    different angles.</p>
